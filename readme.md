 - When started, use `v`,`b` and `space` to hit the incoming bits.
 - you can append `?HTML5` to the end of url to switch to HTML5 audio backend. default backend is flash via SoundManager2.

## how to hack
This project comes with a modest but powerful [beat composer](http://tyt2y3.github.com/celebrate/src/editor.html).
This composer can be easily configured to support other music instrument sounds. This code base is a generic framework for any rhythm game.
